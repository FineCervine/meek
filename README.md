# meek

A shy style that hardly works.

## Intro

The *original* goal of this stylesheet was to create a dark style for eClass, but I've since started using [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org) and adapt my style to better suit my needs. *meek* features increased padding, different typefaces, adjusted mobile view for small viewports/phones, some basic animations, and all around broken experience. It really is tuned to my preferences and my D.E., so go wild and make it yours.

## Installation

Use a user styles manager like [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/)
(available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/)
and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne))
or [xStyle](https://github.com/FirefoxBar/xStyle) ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/xstyle/)
and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xstyle/hncgkmhphmncjohllpoleelnibpmccpj)).

### Install as a UserCSS

## How Course Names Were Changed

Really basic and garbage userscript. Only works on main page and is hard-coded, for now.
